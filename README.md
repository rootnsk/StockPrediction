# StockPrediction

The project is about timeseries prediction on financial data.

I attempted to study the variation of global stock market during covid. It also attempts to capture the nuances of how financial data is studied, i.e. by creating returns 
and further

The data has been scrapped from Yahoo Finance, and I considered UK, USA, germany and Japan's stock prices. Only closing prices have been considered.
